            <p>If there is a user with this username found, you will be redirected to a page with a "secure" link.</p>
            <p>
                This obviously is not secure, but do not currently have implementation setup to use a users email to send them a secure password reset link.
                Which for obvious reasons would be 1,000,000 times better
